This project contains
1) ANS Forth interpreter in ANSForth directory
2) ArrayForth interpreter in ArrayForth directory
3) GreenArrays F18A synthesizer in machine directory

GreenArrays F18A synthesizer or GreenSyn is a synthesizer that synthesizes the optimal F18A code in term of runtime from a given F18A program. GreenSyn is written in Racket and use z3 SMT solver. GreenSyn runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac.

==============================================================
Instructions for setting up GreenSyn on Linux.

1) Download and install z3.

  1.1) Download and install z3 from http://z3.codeplex.com/

  1.2) Add directory that contains z3 binary to your PATH environment variable.

       PATH=@PATH:/path/to/z3/binary/directory

2) Download and install DrRacket or Racket.

DrRacket comes with both Racket interpreter and Racket IDE. If you prefer to use your own choice of editor, you can just install Racket.

  - DrRacket: download from http://racket-lang.org/download/
  - Racket:   sudo apt-get install racket

==============================================================
Instructions for setting up GreenSyn on Windows.
